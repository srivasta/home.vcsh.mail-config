# If you receive mail filtered by upstream mail systems, like a spam 
# filtering ISP or mailing list, and that service adds new headers
# (as most of them do), these headers may provide inappropriate cues
#	to the Bayesian classifier, allowing it to take a "short cut". To
# avoid this, list the headers using this setting.  Example:
bayes_ignore_header X-SpamBouncer
bayes_ignore_header X-SBPass
bayes_ignore_header X-SBClass
bayes_ignore_header X-Folder
bayes_ignore_header X-SBNote
bayes_ignore_header X-SBRule
