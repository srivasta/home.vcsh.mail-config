NAME

	release -- Releases power

SYNOPSIS

	release name

DESCRIPTION

This command releases the specified power.

If the 'root' power is releases, other powers obtained while root or before
are kept. That way, it makes sense to ask for powers while root, when the
password for some minor power has been change, since you do not need to
supply it. Then 'root' may be released and the work continued with the
minor power handy.

It is not recommend to run an entire session with 'root' privileges, unless
needed to bypass some restrictions like the maximum number of commands that
may be issued in a session.
