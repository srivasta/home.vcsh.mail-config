# Small descriptions for programs

* cshar
The useful shell-archive maker. Raphael Manfredi modified the original 
slightly to add a Configure script.
---

* kit
A simple binary tarmailer. This is used by the mail agent when
mailing big sets of files. You presently need cshar (from
Rich Salz) to use kit.
---

* dist
Larry Wall's dist package, modified. It contains:
    - metaconfig, a Configure script generator
    - a patch generator
    - a distribution maker
It comes from version Larry's dist 2.0 PL 2 package, but has
quite a few extensions (I worked especially on the patch
generating tools and metaconfig itself). The units used by
metaconfig have been manually ripped off from some recently
posted Configure scripts (elm 2.3, perl 3.0).
---

* rcs
GNU Revision Control System. You need RCS to use Larry's
dist package (patch generating tools).
---

* cops
Security analysis tools. May be useful to find holes in
your system.
---

* less
The pager that is more than more(1).
---

* flex
Fast lex. Needed for the xfmt package, because lex is not
powerful enough.
---

* perl
Larry Wall's Practical Extraction and Report Language. It
combines the best features of C, awk, sed and sh.
You need it to use the dist package.
---

* patch
The useful utility to apply diff files on a distribution. You could
of course apply them by hand, but it may well be a long procedure !
Written by Larry Wall.
---

* Watcher
Kerberos version 4 patch9 tar'ed, compressed vms saveset. 
---

* logtools
Combined Log System was designed to enable the automatic handling of
log files generated by infosystems daemons (ftp, gopher, CERN / NCSA
http, archie, ...) for Internet archives.  It does this by providing
a combined format for the transfers, and converting each of the raw
log files into this combined format.  The results are then stored by  
date/time, summarized and compressed.
---

* gmake
The GNU `make' utility automatically determines which pieces of a
large program need to be recompiled, and issues the commands to
recompile them.
---

* MOMspider 
MOMspider is a web-roaming robot that specializes in the
maintenance of distributed hypertext infostructures (i.e. 
wide-area webs). The program is written in Perl and, once
customized for your site, should work on any UNIX-based 
system with Perl.
---

* MHonArc
MHonArc is a Perl program for converting e-mail messages as specified
in RFC 822 and RFC 1521 (MIME) to HTML.
---

* guestbook 
Guestbook is a package containing a flexible, security conscious,
cgi-bin script and support files that enables any user on a site to
maintain a guestbook.  In fact, there may be no limit on the number of
guest books, one could run a number of them.  The script is smart
enough to generate a HTML 2.0 compliant fill-out form on the fly,
complete with navigation icons.
